% Using the function call

% In this return set:
%    R is the set of image frames and the detector strength at each image
%    subs(i,:) is the set of center points in space-time of the i'th
%      cuboid.
%    vals(i) is the value of the metric at that point.
%    cuboids(:,:,:,i) is the value set at the cuboid.
%    V is an optional image.
