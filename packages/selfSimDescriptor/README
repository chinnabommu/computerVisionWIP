Self-similarity descriptor based on paper:
Matching Local Self-Similarities across Images and Videos, Eli Shechtman and Michal Irani
CVPR '07

Uses the self-similarity feature descriptor written by 
Varun Gulshan, varun@robots.ox.ac.uk

There is a copy of that file in this repository under /imports. I have 
extended it to include code that computes patch similarity over a given
image. The correlation I'm using isn't exactly what was used in Shechtman
and Irani because it was unclear what method they used. However, I did
base it on Boiman and Irani (ICCV'05), and I used a sigmoid function.

Use at your own risk.

Usage:
imageResp = getDescriptors('../../data/SelfSimilarities/Hearts/data_002.png',3);
patchResp = getDescriptors('../../data/SelfSimilarities/Hearts/query_002.png',3,1);
matches = locatePatch(patchResp{2},imageResp{2});
matchMask = findMaxes(matches);
imagesc(matchMask);
